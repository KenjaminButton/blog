# NextAuth.js Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for adding authentication to the blog using NextAuth.js.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Setup NextAuth Configuration
- Create `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` for the auth API route
- Start with a basic GitHub OAuth provider (easiest to test)
- Add session and JWT callbacks for basic functionality
- Test: Verify the auth endpoints are working by visiting `/api/auth/providers`

### Phase 2: Add Authentication Provider
- Create `app/providers.tsx` to wrap the app with SessionProvider
- Update `app/layout.tsx` to use the provider
- Test: Check if session context is available throughout the app using React DevTools

### Phase 3: Implement Sign In/Out UI
- Add authentication state to Navbar
- Add sign-in/sign-out buttons
- Create a simple protected client component to test session state
- Test: Verify sign-in flow and session persistence

### Phase 4: Protect Admin Routes
- Create middleware.ts to protect `/admin/*` routes
- Update admin page to use session data
- Add loading and error states
- Test: Verify unauthorized users can't access admin pages

### Phase 5: Add Credentials Provider
- Implement username/password authentication
- Set up secure password handling
- Add form validation
- Test: Verify login with test credentials

### Phase 6: Enhance Security
- Add CSRF protection
- Implement rate limiting
- Add proper error handling
- Test: Verify security measures with tools like OWASP ZAP

## Testing Strategy
For each phase:
1. Make small, atomic changes
2. Test the specific functionality added
3. Verify it doesn't break existing features
4. Only proceed when current step is working

## Notes
- Each phase builds upon the previous one
- Testing is integral to each phase
- Security is considered throughout but has dedicated focus in Phase 6
- Implementation order is designed to provide immediate feedback on functionality
