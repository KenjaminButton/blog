      <p>The point guard position has undergone a remarkable transformation over the decades. From pure playmakers to scoring threats, the evolution reflects the changing nature of basketball itself.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Traditional Era</h2>
      <p>Historically, point guards were floor generals first and foremost. Their primary responsibility was to set up teammates and manage the game's tempo. Scoring was secondary to playmaking.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Hybrid Revolution</h2>
      <p>Modern point guards are expected to be both elite scorers and playmakers. This shift began with players like Penny Hardaway, who combined traditional point guard skills with scoring ability.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Today's Game</h2>
      <p>In today's NBA, the lines between positions have blurred. Point guards are often their team's primary scorers, while maintaining their playmaking responsibilities. This evolution has led to some of the most exciting basketball we've ever seen.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Future</h2>
      <p>As basketball continues to evolve, we're likely to see even more versatility from the point guard position. The next generation of players will need to be able to do it all - score, pass, defend, and lead.</p>

      <p>The 2004 Detroit Pistons weren't just a great defensive team - they were a defensive revolution that changed how we think about team basketball.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Foundation</h2>
      <p>At the core of the Pistons' defense was Ben Wallace, a defensive force unlike anything the league had seen. But what made this team special was how every player bought into the defensive system.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The System</h2>
      <p>The Pistons' defensive scheme was built on perfect rotations, communication, and trust. Every player knew exactly where to be and when to be there.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Personnel</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>Ben Wallace: The anchor</li>
        <li>Rasheed Wallace: The versatile defender</li>
        <li>Tayshaun Prince: The lockdown wing</li>
        <li>Chauncey Billups: The smart defender</li>
        <li>Richard Hamilton: The tireless worker</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Legacy</h2>
      <p>The 2004 Pistons proved that defense wins championships, even in an era of high-scoring offenses. Their influence can still be seen in today's defensive schemes.</p>

      <p>The Sacramento Kings of the early 2000s were more than just a basketball team - they were a basketball revolution. Led by the creative genius of Jason Williams and later Mike Bibby, alongside Chris Webber, Vlade Divac, and Peja Stojakovic, the Kings played a style of basketball that was ahead of its time.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Perfect Storm</h2>
      <p>What made these Kings special wasn't just their talent - it was their perfect blend of skills and basketball IQ. Webber's versatility, Divac's passing, and Stojakovic's shooting created a system where every player was a threat from anywhere on the court.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">European Influence</h2>
      <p>The Kings' style was heavily influenced by European basketball, particularly through Divac and Stojakovic. Their emphasis on ball movement, player movement, and creative passing was revolutionary in an era dominated by isolation basketball.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Legacy</h2>
      <p>While they never won a championship, their influence on modern basketball is undeniable. The Warriors' beautiful game, the Spurs' system, and the modern emphasis on ball movement all owe a debt to those Kings teams.</p>
